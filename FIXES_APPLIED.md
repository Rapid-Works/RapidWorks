# Fixes Applied to Next.js Migration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Firebase Messaging Server-Side Initialization Error
**Problem:** Firebase Messaging was trying to initialize on the server-side where `navigator` and `window` don't exist, causing `ReferenceError: navigator is not defined`.

**Solution:**
- Added browser environment check in `src/firebase/messaging.js`
- Wrapped `getMessaging()` initialization in `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check
- Added `'use client'` directive to ensure client-side only execution

**Files Modified:**
- `src/firebase/messaging.js`
- `src/firebase/config.js`

### 2. ✅ Favicon Conflict Error
**Problem:** Next.js 15 detected conflicting favicon files in both `/app/favicon.ico` and `/public/favicon.ico`.

**Solution:**
- Removed `public/favicon.ico` (keeping only the one in `app/`)
- Next.js 15 App Router prefers favicons in the `app/` directory

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `public/favicon.ico`

### 3. ✅ Firebase Analytics Warning
**Problem:** Firebase Analytics attempted to initialize in server environment.

**Status:** Already handled gracefully with try-catch in `config.js` - warning is non-critical.

## Current Status

The application should now:
- ✅ Start without Firebase Messaging errors
- ✅ Load without favicon conflicts
- ✅ Handle Firebase initialization properly in both server and client contexts
- ✅ Display correctly at http://localhost:3000

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** to see the changes
2. **Test the following features:**
   - User authentication
   - Firebase Firestore operations
   - Push notifications (on supported browsers)
   - All page routes

## Remaining Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

- **Analytics warning in console**: This is expected during SSR and doesn't affect functionality
- **metadataBase warning**: Can be fixed by adding `metadataBase` to `layout.tsx` metadata export
