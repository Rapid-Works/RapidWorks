  "branding.faq.showAll": "Show all questions and answers",
  "branding.faq.items.0.question": "What is a Rapid Branding worth?",
  "branding.faq.items.0.answer": "Only you can determine its true value to your business. At agencies, the combined cost of all Rapid Branding components would typically range between €10,000 and €15,000, involving several weeks of waiting time and countless additional hours of coordination on your part. We drastically reduce costs by using a combination of automation and smart processes.",
  "branding.faq.items.1.question": "Why is a Rapid Branding so important for startups?",
  "branding.faq.items.1.answer": "Our honest opinion? It's not. Startup founders have more important things to do than worry about design. We believe the founding team's most important task is to focus on their market and product. However, from both our own founding experience and consulting over 50 startups, we've recognized that developing brand visibility consumes a disproportionate amount of resources in terms of time and money, and contains too many pitfalls for inexperienced founders. While not as complex as the problems startups solve, the connection and coordination of visibility elements is detailed and meticulous. We handle these details for you, aiming to deliver your complete Rapid Branding within days, making you operational for the next year.",
  "branding.faq.items.2.question": "Why should I have RapidWorks create my Rapid Branding?",
  "branding.faq.items.2.answer": "Our team combines startup founding experience with design and development expertise. We know exactly what a startup needs to reach and convince customers. We're also cost and time-efficient in creating Rapid Brandings, having semi-automated the creation of several bundle components.",
  "branding.faq.items.3.question": "In what form do I receive the Rapid Branding contents?",
  "branding.faq.items.3.answer": "Upon completion, you'll receive an email with access to cloud storage containing all components of your Rapid Branding in digital form. Each file is saved in an appropriate format and clearly named. You'll also receive each file in an editable format. Our goal is to make you self-sufficient rather than creating dependency on us or other service providers. We don't provide physical materials, but you can use our files to have them produced at any print shop.",
  "branding.faq.items.4.question": "Does RapidWorks offer other services?",
  "branding.faq.items.4.answer": "Yes, the Rapid Branding is our market entry, but our mission goes much further. We offer personal coaching with Yannick, MVP development, software development services at unbeatable prices, and free financing consultation. See <a href='https://rapidworks.vercel.app/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-violet-600 hover:text-violet-700 underline'>RapidWorks</a> for more information.",
  "branding.faq.items.5.question": "What's the quality level of the Rapid Branding?",
  "branding.faq.items.5.answer": "Comparable to the RapidWorks Rapid Branding you see showcased on this website. Your bundle will be created by Yannick and Samuel, exactly like the RapidWorks Rapid Branding. We're transparent that you shouldn't expect Apple-level design from us, but we're convinced that few startups need that level of design quality in the early stage.",
  "branding.faq.items.6.question": "What if I have special requests for my Rapid Branding?",
  "branding.faq.items.6.answer": "You can note special requests in our form. We'll review them and inform you whether we can implement them within the offer or arrange an alternative solution.",
  "branding.faq.items.7.question": "Do I give up rights to my Rapid Branding or startup idea?",
  "branding.faq.items.7.answer": "You retain all rights to your idea and Rapid Branding. We don't share any data with third parties. However, if your startup targets other startups with design, coaching, or development services, there might be a conflict of interest.",
  "branding.faq.items.8.question": "Who is the Startup Rapid Branding offer for?",
  "branding.faq.items.8.answer": "In short - startups. See <a href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start-up-Unternehmen' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-violet-600 hover:text-violet-700 underline'>Start-up-Unternehmen – Wikipedia</a>. If you're not sure whether you're a startup but need the Rapid Branding, feel free to fill out our form.",
  "branding.faq.items.9.question": "Do I need to have already founded my startup to receive a Rapid Branding?",
  "branding.faq.items.9.answer": "No, you can fill out our application form even if you haven't founded your company yet.",
  "branding.faq.items.10.question": "What if I already have some contents of the Rapid Branding?",
  "branding.faq.items.10.answer": "No problem. In our form, you can upload any files you already have and tell us how to incorporate them into your Rapid Branding.",
  "branding.faq.items.11.question": "When will I receive my Rapid Branding?",
  "branding.faq.items.11.answer": "Since we've semi-automated the creation of several bundle components and are an experienced team in creating Rapid Brandings, we complete at least one bundle per week. We process orders on a <a href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_In_%E2%80%93_First_Out' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='text-violet-600 hover:text-violet-700 underline'>First In – First Out – Wikipedia</a> basis and intentionally keep our pipeline small. Your bundle will be completed promptly and quickly - significantly faster than you could likely create or outsource it yourself.",
  "branding.faq.items.12.question": "How much does it cost to print all the media?",
  "branding.faq.items.12.answer": "Depending on the provider, around €100 per rollup, €30 per hoodie, €20 for 500 business cards. We will soon recommend providers with whom we have had good experiences.",
